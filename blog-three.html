      <h3>What is a Website Framework?</h3> 
 
      <p> 
        Frameworks are divided into two primary categories:
      </p> 
 
      <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Frontend Frameworks</strong>: 
            Focus on the user interface and experience, enabling developers to design and structure the visual aspects of a website. 
            Examples include React, Angular, and Vue.js.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong> Backend Frameworks</strong>: Handle server-side logic, database interactions, and APIs, such as Django, Express.js, or Ruby on Rails.

        </li>
      </ol>
 
 
    <h3> Popular Frontend Frameworks</h3>

      <p>
        Website frameworks provide numerous benefits to developers, including:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li> <strong>React </strong>:
            React is a component-based library maintained by Meta. It simplifies building interactive user interfaces by rendering only what changes on the page. 
            React is often paired with frameworks like Next.js for server-side rendering.</li>

        <li>
            <strong>Angular </strong>:
Angular, developed by Google, is a robust framework for building single-page applications (SPAs). It uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, to enhance development.
        </li>

        <li>
           <strong>Vue.js </strong> :
Vue.js is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a beginner-friendly option for building user interfaces and SPAs.
        </li>
      </ol>
 
      <h3>Popular Backend Frameworks</h3> 
 
     <ol>
        <li><strong> Django</strong>:
            Django, a Python-based framework, emphasizes simplicity and scalability. It includes tools for database management, authentication, and security.</li>
        <li><strong> Express.js</strong>:
            Express.js is a minimalist Node.js framework ideal for creating APIs and web applications. It is widely used due to its flexibility and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Ruby on Rails </strong>:
            Rails is a Ruby-based framework designed for rapid application development. It simplifies database tasks and follows a convention-over-configuration principle.</li>
     </ol>


     <h3>Key Features of Frameworks</h3>

     <ol>
        <li> <strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture </strong>:
            Frameworks often use MVC, dividing applications into three interconnected components:
        
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Model </strong>: Manages data and logic.</li>
                <li><strong> View </strong> : Displays the user interface.</li>
                <li><strong> Controller</strong>: Handles user input and updates the model and view.</li>
            </ul>
        
        </li>
            
        <li>
            <strong>Routing </strong>:
            Frameworks provide tools to manage URLs and route user requests to the appropriate components or pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong> Templates </strong>:
            Frontend frameworks often include templates to create consistent layouts and design elements.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Built-in Security </strong>:
Features like input validation and protection against SQL injection are included in most frameworks.
        </li>
     </ol>
 
    <h3>Choosing the Right Framework</h3>
    <p>When selecting a framework, consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Project Requirements </strong>: The size, complexity, and goals of your project.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Expertise </strong>: The skills and familiarity of your team with specific frameworks.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Needs</strong>: Frameworks vary in speed and efficiency for different tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Website frameworks are the backbone of modern web development, simplifying processes and improving efficiency. Whether you're building a personal blog or 
        a scalable enterprise application, understanding the fundamentals of website frameworks is essential for creating functional and professional websites.</p>
